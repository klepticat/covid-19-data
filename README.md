**Summary**

This is a python script that searches data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases based on an input country. The output is meant to be used in a line graph, with the days as the x-axis and the cases as the y-axis.

This script was created for the Comparing Functions Project at Mary Person's High School.
